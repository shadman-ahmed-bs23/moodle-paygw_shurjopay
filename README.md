## ShurjoPay Payment Gateway

ShurjoPay is the first online payment gateway of Bangladesh founded in 2010, when e-commerce was just starting to take off in Bangladesh. An online payment gateway (PG) is a tunnel that connects your bank account to the platform where you need to transfer your money. Not only that, it also connects the MFSs. ShurjoPay acts as an aggregator between their merchants and all the payment services (Banks, MFSs) available in Bangladesh. Using shurjoPay, any e-commerce business, education institute or any other institutes can collect their payments from their users.
